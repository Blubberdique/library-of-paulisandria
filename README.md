Welcome to the library of Paulisandria! This is my library of Digispark and Rubber Ducky payloads, and a repository I made for those interested in learning how to code either through Arduino for the Digispark, or through Ducky Script for the Rubber Ducky.



The file "---.txt" contains the basics for writing and deploying a payload to the Digispark USB.

The file "---.txt" contains the basics for writing and deploying a payload to the Rubber Ducky.

The file "---txt" contains the method to keybinding and a list of possible keybinds.



All payloads will be saved in .txt files to avoid anti-virus deleting anything when you download/clone the repository.
